=== Lemma 1 ===

Let $\xi$ be an irrational number.

Let $A \in \mathbb{R}$ be a real number strictly greater than $\sqrt{5}$.

Then there may exist at most a finite number of relatively prime integers $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that:

$$\left| {\xi - \dfrac{p}{q}}\right| < \dfrac {1}{A \, q^2}$$

=== Lemma 2 ===

Let $\xi$ be an irrational number.

Let there be $3$ consecutive convergents of the continued fraction to $\xi$.

Then at least one of them, $\dfrac{p}{q}$ say, satisfies:
$$\left| {\xi - \dfrac{p}{q}}\right| < \dfrac {1}{\sqrt{5} \, q^2}$$


There are an infinite number of convergents to $\xi$.

Taking these in sets of $3$ at a time, it can be seen from Lemma 2 that at least one of them satisfies the given inequality.

From Lemma 1 it is seen that this inequality is the best possible.
