Let $S$ be a set.

Let $\tau$ be a set of subsets of $S$.

Show that $\tau$ is a topology on $S$ if and only if:

$(1): \quad$ Any intersection of arbitrarily many closed sets of $S$ under $\tau$ is a closed set of $S$ under $\tau$

$(2): \quad$ The union of any finite number of closed sets of $S$ under $\tau$ is a closed set of $S$ under $\tau$

$(3): \quad S$ and $\varnothing$ are both closed sets of $S$ under $\tau$

where a closed set $V$ of $S$ under $\tau$ is defined as a subset of $S$ such that $S \backslash V \in \tau$.
