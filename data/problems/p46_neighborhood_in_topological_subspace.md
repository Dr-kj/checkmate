Let $\left( {X, \tau}\right)$ be a topological space.

Let $S \subseteq X$ be a subset of $X$.

Let $\tau_S$ denote the subspace topology on $S$.

Let $x \in S$ be an arbitrary point of $S$.

Let $E \subseteq S$.


Show that
$E$ is a neighborhood of $x$ in $\left( {S, \tau_S}\right)$
if and only if:

$\exists D \subseteq X$ such that:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$D$ is a neighborhood of $x$ in $X$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$E = D \cap S$.
