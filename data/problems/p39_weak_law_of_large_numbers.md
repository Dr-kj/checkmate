Let $P$ be a population. Let $P$ have mean $\mu$ and finite variance. Let $\langle {X_n}\rangle_{n  \geq 1}$ be a sequence of random variables forming a random sample from $P$.

Let: 

$$\mathrm{} {\overline {X}_n} = \frac {1}{n} \sum_{i  = 1}^n X_i$$


Then show that

$${\overline {X}_n} \rightarrow^p \mu$$

where $\rightarrow^p$ denotes convergence in probability.
