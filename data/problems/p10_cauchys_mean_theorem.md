Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}$ be real numbers which are all positive.

Let $A_n$ be the arithmetic mean of $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$.

Let $G_n$ be the geometric mean of $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$.


Show that 
$$A_n \geq G_n$$
with equality holding iff:
$$\forall i, j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}: x_i = x_j,$$
that is, iff all terms are equal.
