Let the events $E_n$ be independent. Let the sum of the probabilities of the $E_n$ diverges to infinity.


Show that the probability that infinitely many of them occur is $1$. 

That is, show that if $\mathrm{} \sum_{n  = 1}^\infty \Pr \left({E_n}\right) = \infty$ and the events $\mathrm{} \langle {E_n} \rangle ^\infty_{n  = 1}$ are independent, then:
$$\mathrm{} \Pr \left({\limsup_{n  \to \infty} E_n}\right) = 1$$
