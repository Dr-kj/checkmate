Let $G$ and $H$ be $n$-dimensional vector spaces over a field.

Let $\mathcal{L} \left({G, H}\right)$ be the set of all linear transformations from $G$ to $H$.

Let $u \in \mathcal{L} \left({G, H}\right)$.

Let $u^t$ be the transpose of $u$.

Prove that $u$ and $u^t$ have the same rank and nullity.
