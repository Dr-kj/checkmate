Let the probability of the occurrence of an event be $p$. Let $n$ independent trials be made, with $k_n$ being the random variable that counts the number of successes in these trials.


Show that for any $\varepsilon>1$:
$$\lim_{n  \to \infty} \mathrm{Pr}(|\frac{k_n}{n}-p|<\varepsilon) = 1,$$

that is, the mean number of successes lies with high probability close to the probability of the event.
